# Store_Data_Analysis_Project_Using_SQL
This project consists of exploratory data analysis of the database of a store that sells bike using SQL as the tool for analysis


## PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The store is a company that deals with the bikes sales.In this project I did some exploratory analysis on the database  of this store with SQL Server using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) 


## DATABASE DESCRIPTION

The database consists of two schemas( a schema is the organization of data as a blueprint of how the database is constructed),the sales schema and the production schema


## SCHEMA AND TABLE CREATION
The  sales schema consists of the customers,staffs,orders,stores,order_items tables while the production schema consists of thr categories,products,stocks and brands table.
This [query](https://github.com/Adebesindedayo/Bikestore_Exploratory_Data_Analysis_Project_Using_SQL/blob/main/Bikestore_schema_and_tables.sql) shows how I created different tables for each schema.

## LOADING THE DATABASE
This shows the [query](https://github.com/Adebesindedayo/Bikestore_Exploratory_Data_Analysis_Project_Using_SQL/blob/main/BikeStores_populating_the_database.sql)  I used to load the database into the Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio
